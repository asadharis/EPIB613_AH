This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) example using R Notebooks. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 


When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Introduction

In this simple document, we will illustrate some of the *features* of **rmarkdown**. We have already emphasized some text using *italics* and then **bold**. We can also express displeasure at some line by ~~striking through it~~. 

## Incorporating R code in a document

To use R code, we need to include a code chunck. We will do some simple calculations in R.

```{r}
4+2
7-8*(2/3)
2^4
abs(-5)
sin(pi/2)
log2(10)
```

### We can use an option to make things neater
```{r, collapse=TRUE}
4+2
7-8*(2/3)
2^4
abs(-5)
sin(pi/2)
log2(10)
```

### Or simply display code without doing anything:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

### Or not display code just the output:
```{r,echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
