Overview of R
========================================================

- R is a programming language built upon the S-language developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories.

- It is a \textcolor{red}{free} software environment for statistical computing and graphics.

- To learn more about the history of R see:
    + R-project page: https://www.r-project.org/about.html
    + Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)

Why R?
========================================================

- Free, open-source, multi-platform
- Excellent community of users and developers
    + The number of things you can do with a single line of code is continuously growing through new packages (more on this later)
- Has an excellent integrated development environment (IDE): **Rstudio**
    + Makes working with base-R and other add-ons more user friendly
- A \textcolor{blue}{programming language} that can be used on a spectrum
    + Has tools to do almost point-and-click statistical analysis
    + Flexibility of writing your own code/functions/analysis 


Installing base-R
========================================================

- Available for multiple platforms
    + Windows ($\ge$ Windows 7) 
    + OS X (MAC) 
    + Linux (ubuntu, debian, redhat, suse)
- Download required files from: https://cran.r-project.org/
    + For MAC, you need to download the .pkg file, open and follow instructions
    + For Windows, you need the .exe file, open and follow instructions

Installing RStudio
========================================================
- RStudio is the free R integrated development environment (IDE) that is available from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/
- It has useful features such as syntax highlighting and tab for suggested code auto-completion.
- It involves four-pane workspace, which better manages multiple R windows for typing commands, storing scripts, viewing command histories, viewing visualizations and more.
- We will work with Rstudio to do things in R for this course.

Rstudio Shortcuts
=======================================================

- Keyboard shortcuts can make coding faster and efficient
- IDE displays list of shortcuts \textcolor{blue}{tools-> Keyboard Shortcuts Help} or press \textcolor{blue}{Alt+Shift+K (Option+Shift+K on Mac)} 
- Some useful shortcuts to remember:
    + **tab** key for auto compltete code. In console or editor start typing and press **tab** key to display list of suggestions.
    + **Ctrl+Enter (Command+Enter on Mac)** runs the current line of code. If multiple lines selected/highlighted all selected lines will run in the console. 
    + **Ctrl+S (Command+S on Mac)** saves the file in editor, good to continously save work incase R or Rstudio crashes (don`t worry, it happens to everyone).
  
First steps in R
=======================================================

- First we want to set a working directory.
- You can use the default (usually where R is installed or $HOME) however the working directory is where any exported results/reports/tables/plots will be saved. 
- Having raw data in the working directory also makes importing data easy.

```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/Asad/Dropbox")
setwd("~/")
setwd("~/work")
```

- In Studio, we can also use \textcolor{blue}{Session -> Set Working Directory}

Basic calculations in R
=======================================================

- To start, we can use R as a calculator. All simple operations: +, -, *, /, ^
```{r,collapse=TRUE}
4+2
7-8*(2/3)
2^4
```

- R also comes with some built-in math functions
```{r, collapse = TRUE}
abs(-5)
sin(pi/2)
log2(10)
```

Functions and pacakges
=======================================================

- We have already used **functions** in R, i.e. `setwd()`, `abs()`, `log2()` are all examples of functions.
- A function in R (or any programming language) is like a function in math:
    + It is *something* which takes in certain \textcolor{red}{input}, performs some operations on this input and returns \textcolor{red}{output}
    + We have seen some built-in functions, but we can \textcolor{blue}{define our own functions} or \textcolor{blue}{use functions defined by others}.
    + Developers and users can write useful functions and share them as \textcolor{red}{R-packages}
  
- An R-package is a collection of functions, data and compiled code. 
    + There are MANY R-packages out there!
    + It is extremely helpful for methods papers to have an accompanying package.
    + For any project/paper making an R-package helps \emph{reproducibility}. 

Installing and loading packages
=====================================================
- We have seen that Rstudio shows list of installed packages. 
- We can install packages using the Rstudio GUI or in command line:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("the-package-name")

install.packages("ggformula")
install.packages("mosaic")
```

- Once installed we can need to \emph{load} a package to use its functions:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
load(the-package-name)
```
- Packages need to be re-loaded everytime we start a new session. 


Rmarkdown: tools for reproducible research
=====================================================

- Markdown is a \emph{markup language}, a system that can be used to create documents. 
    + Purpose of this was to have a simple syntax markup language
    + Rmarkdown, builds upon that and allowing us to incorporate R (and even other programming languages!)
  
- Simple Rmarkdown can be used for creating simple documents. But it can do much more:
    + Create a variety of formatted documents in multiple formats (pdf, html, etc)
    + Allows users to easily insert tables, lists, math equations
    + Can be used to write papers for journals/conferences
    + Commonly used to write software manuals for R packages
    + Your EPIB 607 assignments
    + These slides were made in Rmarkdown!
    
    
Rmarkdown in action
=====================================================
- Easy quickstart: use the template in Rstudio
- Using the simple markdown syntax we can create documents
    + For a quick start: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html
    + In "Help -> Cheatsheets", we have a reference guide and a cheatsheet. 
- We can include \emph{\textcolor{red}{code chunks}}
    + These literally have chuncks of code which are executed when the document is \emph{compiled}
    + We can add options various options for code chuncks which leads to different results (both aesthetically and code output)
- A recent addition to Rstudio is \textcolor{red}{R Notebooks}
    + R Notebooks are rmarkdown documents but now the code is executed on-the-fly.
    
- A simple Rmarkdown document
